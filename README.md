## Oak

Oak is a series of dotnet libraries I pulled out from personal projects and organized into neat packages. 

The libraries are mostly focused around ASP.NET based projects and dependency injection. Feel free to use them in your own projects, contribute or ask questions.

The project consists of several libraries:
- Oak.Email
    - Various email client abstractions including `System.Mail`, `Mailkit` and `Sendgrid`.
- Oak.Events
    - Create and dispatch events through dependency injection. 
- Oak.Webhooks
    - Create, build and trigger webhooks to other services.
- Oak.TaskScheduler
    - Hosted service for running tasks on the schedule.
